<div><h2>Attended clojure.tokyo #4</h2><p class="blog-post"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/clojure-tokyo/events/238952073/">clojure.tokyo</a>  is a monthly meetup held at tacchi that started this April. This was my second time attending this event (I attender &quot;#2&quot; previously) .</p><h3>descjop</h3><p class="blog-post">The session started off by Hara san (aka <a href="https://github.com/karad">karad</a>) giving a nice intro on how to develop an electron app with ClojureScript using his  <a href="https://github.com/karad/lein_template_descjop">descjop</a>  template. Electron is a platform to build desctop applications that work for all major operating systems using JavaScript. The  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/karadweb/clojuretokyodescjop?qid=e1816aa3-2f26-4cc9-bb44-05353c647345&amp;v=&amp;b=&amp;from_search=1">slides</a>  were really concise and easy to follow along, and the instructions took me from knowing nothing about electron to setting up a reagent hello world app with figwheel set up in less than 10 minutes. Pretty impressive!</p><h3>Got hands a bit dirty</h3><p class="blog-post">After getting the hello world up and running, I paired up with  <a href="https://github.com/keansant">Kean</a>  and decided to implement a trivial example where selecting a color from a select input would cause the text color of the app to be the selected color. Once we got that working we dumped the work  <a href="https://github.com/keansant/lein_template_descjop">here.</a></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p class="blog-post">Overall attending this event was totally more than worth my time, becaue 1) I actually got to get a hands on session about a cool tool from the author of that tool. and 2) It was my first time pairing with a person I met that day, and learned that solving a problem together was a good way to get to know a person. Looking forward to the clojure.tokyo meetup.</p></div>
