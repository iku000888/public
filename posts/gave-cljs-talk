<div><h2>Gave a short talk about ClojureScript</h2><p class="blog-post">I attended a small Javascript study group (I think there were 6 or 7 people) The first half of the session was dedicated to individual focus time, which I spent on putting this site on github.io. An bour and a half into the studytime came the time for the talks. Before my talk <a href="https://twitter.com/mqtsuo02">Matsuo Obu</a> talked about ReactVR with a domo. It was a pretty impressive piece of technology and apparantly there are a lot of samples to play around with, so it might be fun to translate the samples using ClojureScript. My talk was about the strengths of ClojureScript. <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/IkuruKanuma/welcome-to-clojurescript">(slides)</a> The main motivation of making the talk was to convince JavaScript people to check out ClojureScript. I think the feedback was generally positive, and I feel like giving this same talk at other JavaScript meetups would be effective towards increasing the adoption of ClojureScript in Japan. (There are only a handful of companies right now.)</p></div>
