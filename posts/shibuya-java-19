<div><h2>Attended Shibuya Java #19</h2><p class="blog-post">This weekend I was lucky to attend and give a talk at <a href="https://shibuya-java.connpass.com/event/57368/">Shibuya Java #19</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.bizreach.co.jp">Bizreach </a>at their resort themed event space. I enjoyed giving my short presnetation as well as seeing all of the other presentations. Below is a summary of the talks given at the event:</p><div><h3>PredictionIO - by hagino_takahiro</h3><p class="blog-post">Bizreach was making heavy use of machine learning technologies to the extent where any managed services (ex &quot;Amazon/Azul/Google&quot;) were not well suited. They looked for an open source product that they can tune and manage by them self, and landed on <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-predictionio">predictionIO.</a> They made significant invenstments to the extent that 4 Bizreach employees were granted committer status to the project.</p></div><div><h3>Mocking the cloud with LocalStack - by shimamoto</h3><p class="blog-post"><a href="https://github.com/atlassian/localstack">LocakStack</a>  is a tool for mocking AWS services during local dev time. Apparantly it is quite usable under normal use, with JUnit support and configurable failure probabilities for the services, which would be useful for simulating things that are hard to reproduce on the actual cloud (ex: throughput error ). It was entertaining to hear that when using the provided JUnit helpers, it would actually invoke make under the hood and fail if a prerequisite is not installed.</p></div><div><h3>MP in Clojure - by <a href="https://twitter.com/lagenorhynque">lag√©norhynque</a></h3><p class="blog-post">There are two major Monad implementations in the Clojure World, <a href="https://github.com/clojure/algo.monads">algo.monads</a> and <a href="https://github.com/funcool/cats">cats.</a> and then went onto showing how some classes of problems can be expressed succinctly using them.</p></div><div><h3>The best of Alt Java is Xtend - by <a href="https://twitter.com/takezoen">Naoki Takezoe</a></h3><p class="blog-post"><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend</a>  is a &apos;dialect of Java&apos; that compiles into Java source code, supported by a small group of passionate developers. Apparantly it has first class Eclipse support etc and some other nice features to cope with the verbosity of Java. There were some giggle worthy remarks such as</p><q class="blog-post">Project tag line is &apos;Java 10 today&apos; while Java 9 release is getting delayed</q><q class="blog-post">It compiles into readable Java code, so it can be used in situations where you do not want to write Java, but the deliverable is Java source code</q></div><div><h3>Graal VM - by <a href="https://twitter.com/takezoen">vertical_blank</a></h3><p class="blog-post">Graal is a JIT compiler written in Java that bundles together<ul class="blog-post"><li>truffle</li><li>JavaScript(+node js)</li><li>Ruby</li><li>R</li></ul></p><p class="blog-post">More specifically that means there is a runtime that provides an interpreter for all of the above. Apparantly it is possible to invoke all sorts of Java constructs from JavaScript/Ruby etc, which is pretty impressive. I imagine a lot of effort is being pourd into this product to support these different interpreters, but it definitely has its apeal to polyglot minded environments.</p></div><div><h3>Clojure Web Dev History - by Me</h3><p class="blog-post">I prepared a talk from the slides that were eliminated from the  <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/IkuruKanuma/arachne-unweaved-jp">talk I gave at JJUG CCC.</a>  They were eliminated mainly because they were not directly related to the topic and time was limited. I think the audiences enjoyed the talk, and it made me really happy to see my research effort not go to waste.</p></div><p class="blog-post">Takezoe san&apos;s blog contains <a href="http://takezoe.hatenablog.com/entry/2017/06/20/082020"> links to the slides</a></p></div>
