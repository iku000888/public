      Bizreach was making heavy use of machine learning technologies to the extent where
      any managed services (ex "Amazon/Azul/Google")  were not well suited. They looked for
      an open source product that they can tune and manage by them "self," and landed on)

     (resume.macros/p
      They made significant invenstments to the extent that 4 Bizreach employees were
      granted committer status to the project.)

      " " is a tool for mocking AWS services during local dev time. Apparantly it is quite usable
      under normal "use," with JUnit support and configurable failure probabilities for the "services,"
      which would be useful for simulating things that are hard to reproduce on the actual cloud
      "(ex:" throughput error ")."

      It was entertaining to hear that when using the provided JUnit "helpers," it would actually
      invoke make under the "hood" and fail if a prerequisite is not installed.)]]

      More specifically that means there is a runtime that provides an interpreter for all of the
      above. Apparantly it is possible to invoke all sorts of Java constructs from
      "JavaScript/Ruby etc," which is pretty impressive. I imagine a lot of effort is being
      pourd into this product to support these different "interpreters," but it definitely has its
      apeal to polyglot minded environments.)]]
